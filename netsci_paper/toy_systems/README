This directory contains scripts that run tests and benchmarks
using the Gaussian distributions. In order to generate the
figure that shows the accuracy of Kraskov's algorithm
for different distribution covariances and different numbers
of sampled data points, one must first run the script:

python gaussian_computed_vs_exact_generate.py

That will probably take several days to complete. Once that 
is done, the plot can be generated:

python gaussian_computed_vs_exact_plot.py

The benchmarks can be performed and plotted with the following
command:

python benchmark.py
